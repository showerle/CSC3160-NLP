# Assignment 1

[Yuxiao Li] [221041017]

## Deadline Feb 14th, 11:59pm

## Instructions

There are 100 marks in assignment 1. Your score times 12% will be the credit towards your total grade.

When you are submitting your assignment, replace 'YOUR_NAME' with your real name, and 'YOUR_STUDENT_ID' with your student ID. The correct format is: '[Xueyao Zhang] [222042021]'. We will deduct 2 marks if the format is incorrect.

[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is recommended, but not necessary. You can use your own environment.

Detailed instructions of each step are in assignment_1.ipynb. If you use Colab to work on the assignment, please make a copy to your own colab/drive with the following link: 

        https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12mizZLhrAHh1tq0DgPBOZeLiJz_-Hf3f?usp=sharing

When you finish your assignment, SAVE a copy in GitHub, we will grade your assignment in GitHub.

## Rules

Here are some rules:
* You need to write comments for your code. Your comments are part of the grading
* We encourage discussions, however not copying. We will use software to detect copy and have punishment for copying (ZERO mark for copying and for who shares their code)
* If ChatGPT-like model is used for assignment, ZERO as well
* All the code need to submit in GitHub. We will use the GitHub timestamp to track when you submit your assignment

We may adjust rules when we see a fit.

Good luck!
